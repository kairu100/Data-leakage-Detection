Credit Card Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting credit card activity using a RandomForestClassifier. The dataset includes information such as card ownership, reports, age, income, and more. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

Project Highlights
Data Collection and Preprocessing: The dataset is read from a CSV file and preprocessed to interpret boolean values.

Model Training: A RandomForestClassifier with 100 estimators is trained on the preprocessed dataset.

Predictions on New Data: The trained model is used to make predictions on new data using a pipeline for preprocessing.

Model Evaluation: The model's accuracy is assessed on a test set and using cross-validation metrics.

Anomaly Detection: The Isolation Forest algorithm is applied to identify outliers in the credit card dataset.

Loading a Pre-trained Model: A pre-trained RandomForest model is loaded from a file for future predictions.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters of the RandomForestClassifier model are tuned using GridSearchCV.

Debugging for Leaky Predictors: The code identifies and evaluates potential leaky predictors in time-dependent data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations, including pairplots and a correlation heatmap, are used to explore relationships and correlations in the dataset.
